# Insert-in-middle-of-linked-list-GFG
Given the head of a Singly Linked List and a value x. The task is to insert the key in the middle of the linked list.

Examples :

Input: LinkedList = 1->2->4 , x = 3
Output: 1->2->3->4
Explanation: 

The new element is inserted after the current middle element in the linked list.
Input: LinkedList = 10->20->40->50 , x = 30
Output: 10->20->30->40->50
Explanation: 

The new element is inserted after the current middle element in the linked list and Hence, the output is 10->20->30->40->50.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxilliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
0 <= number of nodes <= 105
0 <= node->data , x <= 103
